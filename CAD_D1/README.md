Tektronix 4050 Series Application Library ---- CAD_D1 062-5977-01
----

CAD_D1 is a Tektronix 4050 Applications Library 8 inch floppy disk with several different programs.

The abstract for these programs and the full user documentation files are also in this folder.

Be sure to look at the hardware requirements - some of the programs require 4052 or 4054 computers, some require 64KB RAM, etc.

-------------
I don't know if any of these programs can be converted to run on a tape drive.

The Drafting program cannot - as it uses the random access capability of the 4907 floppy disk file manager.
----------------
I have not captured all the files on this disk.
Many of them are in BINARY format
