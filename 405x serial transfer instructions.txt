Tektronix 4050 serial transfers to or from a PC
-----------------------------------------------

This program assumes you have a working 405x computer with working tape drive and at least one good tape.

I have found the original tapes from the 70's and 80's have bad drive belts.
Search the vcfed.org forum for QIC tape repair instructions.
Best source of replacement belts are to remove the ones in a 3M DC6150 or 3M DC6250 new/old stock cartridges.

I used half an old PC printer cable 25-pin end to make my serial cable, and an ohmmeter to find the wire on the 25-pin connector that I wanted to solder to the 9-pin Female connector.  I used a 9-pin Female connector with solder cups on the pins and a backshell.

I also recommend after soldering a cable wire to the 9-pin connector, that you recheck the connection from both ends using the ohmmeter.

The pin numbers for both connectors should be embossed in the plastic holding the pins.

PC serial software and configuration
------------------------------------

I recommend PUTTY or EXTRAPUTTY - both free software downloads.

Select "Serial" underneath Port.  Ensure the COM port number is correct - default is COM1

Then select Serial in Category menu near the bottom.
Set the Speed to 9600, 7 data bits, 1 stop bit, Even Parity, XON/XOFF flow control

Select Window in the Category menu and increase the number of lines of scrollback to 99999.

Select Session in the Category menu and type a name for this session - like 4051 and select Save.

Plug your serial cable between the 4051/4052/4054 and PC. 

Manually enter the bootstrap serial program into the Tektronix:
---------------------------------------------------------------

Type in the following program, and save it before running it :)
							       -------------------------
I have removed the REMARKS, the full program you will load in has all of the remarks
Press the Auto Number key near the top of the keyboard

100 M$=CHR(13)
110 CALL "RATE",2400,2,0
120 CALL "RCRLF",1,2,0
130 CALL "RSTRIN","",M$,"*COP*"
140 CALL "TCRLF",1,2,1
150 PRINT "ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION LINK to PC"
160 PRINT "Press User Definable Key #5 to switch back to BASIC MODE"
170 CALL "CMSET"
180 CALL "TERMIN"
190 PRINT "YOU ARE NOW IN BASIC MODE"
200 PRINT "PC DISC TO 4052 TAPE TRANSFER"
210 PRINT @32,26:2
220 PRINT "INSERT THE TAPE AND INPUT THE FILE # TO RECEIVE DATA ";
230 INPUT F
240 FIND F
250 CALL "RCRLF",1,2,1
260 CALL "CMSET"
270 CALL "DTRECV"
280 CALL "RCRLF",1,2,0
290 PRINT "TRANSMISSION COMPLETE"


Now to test your bootstrap program. Run your serial program.

Plug in the serial cable between the 4051 and PC.

Type RUN on the 405x to run your 4051 Bootstrap program.

The 4051 BUSY then I/O lights should flash once then stop
flashing. This means the 4051 senses the connection to the PC. If the
lights don't stop flashing, recheck your serial cable pinout.

When the lights stop flashing, try typing on the PC side in the
serial window. You won't see an echo of your typing on the PC but
should see it fine on the 4051.

Try typing on the 4051, you should see that in the serial console window.

Great. Now you are ready to transfer the full program that is attached to
this email. Save the attachment on your PC.

On the 4051, press the User Definable Key #5, the program should now print
several lines and ask for you to 
INSERT THE TAPE AND INPUT THE FILE NUMBER TO RECEIVE THE DATA.

You should put in a tape to write this program on and have already MARKed
the size of the file for 4096 bytes - if not, press the 4051 BREAK key twice
to stop the bootstrap program and prepare the tape. 

Then you can RUN the bootstrap program and hit the UserDef Key#5.

Input the file number you will be writing TO on the 4051.

The 4051 will then be waiting for the file transfer.
On the PC, pull down the Transfer | Send Text File dialog box in
Hyperterminal. Browse and select the file that I attached to this email.
Click OK. You should hear the tape drive storing the file. 

When the PC is done (no more 4051 tape activity) you need to type on the PC serial console window:
*COP*

This will close the file on the 4051 tape and you should see "TRANSMISSION
COMPLETE"

You now have the full 4051 send/receive program. Try it out on a file.

Like I said, this program converts 4051 control characters (typically in
PRINT statements for formatting) into three ASCII characters "~X~" (where X is the ASCII letter that you type with the Control key pressed). This conversion is necessary to keep the serial program from going wild trying to print the control characters.
