# New tapedump of a different General Utilites Vol1 Tape1 - with a "27" sticker

I can't read all the files on my original General Utilities tape.

I have written a tapedump program using my TransEra Super Utilites ROM Pack
to capture every 256 byte block on the tape.

The tapedump file contains the complete tape capture including file headers.
SECRET and BINARY files were captured by encoding each byte as two ASCII HEX characters

*********
These files are compatible with the entire 4050 series.

Please use the other General Utilities folder with the 405x web based Emulator program.
***********
The SECRET files on the tapes were captured in ASCII HEX characters.
I have used an online HEX to binary converter to create the binary file versions
*******************************
Note:
My tapedump program prints a Carriage Return after a tape header block.
Otherwise it does not add a CR.

Binary and SECRET files are terminated with a CR

You will notice some left over garbage within the 256 byte header and after 
the CR terminating some of the ASCII programs.

These are remnants from previous recordings.
