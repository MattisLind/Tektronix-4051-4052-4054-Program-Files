These music files only work with the Tektronix 4051 - as they use the 4051 BASIC 'CALL "EXEC"' command 
---

4051_MusicEXEC.BAS program is standalone with Music in internal DATA statements
---
I just added six pages of instruction on the Tektronix MUSIC format from the R12 Graphics Enhancement ROM Pack.
I don't know if it is the exact same format as the 4051 MUSIC program - but I think it may be close.
---
4051_MusicFromFILE.BAS must be copied to a tape.
All the DAT files must be created with the file numbers in front of the names.  You will need one more program on that tape so the DAT files start at file 3.
