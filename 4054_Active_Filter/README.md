My Tektronix 4054A graphics computer running a 40 year old DC300 program tape I recovered that contained an Active Filter program in BASIC.

This program is designed to run on a 4054 computer which has scalable vector fonts.
The 4052 photo in this folder shows that the 4052 running this program cannot display the text at the right scale to match the 4054.

The Tektronix 4051 (1975), 4052 and 4054 (1979) had unique storage tube vector graphics screens with very high resolution.  The 4051 and 4052 had 12" flat screen storage tube CRTs with addressable vector resolution of 1024 by 780.   

The 4054 had a 19" curved screen storage tube CRT with 4096 by 3072 addressable vector resolution!  This program illustrates both the high resolution, vector fonts and fast drawing speed of this computer.

Since the 4050 series graphics computers were limited to a maximum of 64K bytes of memory - the programs made heavy use of the tape drive or external GPIB floppy or hard disk storage for many programs like the one in the video.  You can hear the tape drive being accessed to get the curves drawn for each of the three graphs on the right of the screen.  The DC300 tape drive in the Tektronix computers provided about 300K bytes of storage, with a file system that numbered each file and provided error checking to protect the information in each file.

The tape I recovered contained programs developed 40 years ago by a company using the 4054 computer to design satellites.  This program was apparently part of a internal presentation on using a particular active filter in their satellite design - and showed graphs of the performance of this filter.

Tektronix 4050 series computers had BASIC in ROM that included support not only for the internal screen, tape and keyboard, but also GPIB devices like external graphics printers, plotters, tape drives, floppy drives, hard drives, digitizers, and joysticks.

This program can be changed to plot this image by changing one BASIC statement from Q=32 (internal screen) to Q=1 (external plotter)!

I recovered all the files from this 40 year old tape - see more details in my Tektronix 4051 / 4052 / 4054 thread on vcfed dot org:
