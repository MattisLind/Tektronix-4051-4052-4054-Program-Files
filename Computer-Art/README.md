This folder contains 4050 programs that exhibit 1970's computer graphics art.
**********
All program files are in my Universal format (CR is terminator for each line)
Screenshots are from the 405x javascript emulator of the 4051 - jaggies are due to the pixels used in the emulator for lines, the 'real' 4050 computers draw perfectly straight lines on their storage tube displays.
