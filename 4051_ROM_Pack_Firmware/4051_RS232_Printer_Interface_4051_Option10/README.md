My **4051 RS-232 Printer Interface ROM Pack** contained one 1Kx8 MOTOROLA MCM68308 mask ROM

*** However, I was unable to read this ROM - Data I/O reported Dev Inserted Backwards error :(

The MOTOROLA MCM68308 mask ROM - I think you can use the Data I/O Unipak and Unipak 2B FAMILY/PINOUT 21/27 for an Intel 2708 EPROM
with ROM pin 18 pulled out of the Data I/O ZIF socket and connected to pin 24 for +5V as shown in the printer interface schematic in the 
4051 Service Manual 2.

I included photos of end of the ROM case and front of the case with front and back sides of the circuit board.

there are no ROM files.
