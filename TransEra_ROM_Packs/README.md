This folder contains TransEra 4052/4054 ROM Pack images that I have captured
All these ROM Packs only work on the 4052/4054 and 4052A/4054A Tektronix computers
-----

Each set of ROM PACK firmware images and photos are in separate folders
-------
There are TransEra ROM Pack manuals for most of these on http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/transEra/
-------
For ROM Packs with more than one ROM or EPROM, there are binary images for each ROM.  Each binary image filename includes the CHECKSUM-16 for that file.

Photos of each of my ROM Packs including the outside label and circuit boards are also included


I captured each ROM on my DATA I/O with Unipak 2B in Motorola format (82).

I used HxD to import the .MOT file, and then used HxD to save the .BIN file.
