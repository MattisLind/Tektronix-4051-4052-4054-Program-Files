Full set of 4050R12 Graphics Enhancement Demo Tape ASCII BASIC programs and DATA files.
-----
The files with the file number at the beginning of the filename should be saved to a tape using that file number.
Tape Header filenames for the demo tape are in the TLIST file.
----------------
Also included in this folder are screenshots of demos from the 4050R12 Graphics Enhancement demo tape
---
I also created some BASIC programs that do not require the 4050R12 ROM Pack, but show some of the demos.
