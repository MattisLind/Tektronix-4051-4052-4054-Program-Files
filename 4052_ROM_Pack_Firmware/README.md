This folder contains 4052 ROM Pack Firmware Images I captured from my 4052 ROM Packs
Each set of ROM PACK firmware images and photos are in separate folders
-------
For ROM Packs with more than one ROM or EPROM, there are binary images for each ROM.  Each binary image file includes the CHECKSUM-16 for that file.

Photos of each of my ROM Packs including the outside label and circuit boards are also included


I captured each ROM on my DATA I/O with Unipak 2B in Motorola format (82).

I used HxD to import the MOT file, and then used HxD to save the .BIN file.
