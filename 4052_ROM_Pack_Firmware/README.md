This folder contains 4052 ROM Pack Firmware Images I captured from my 4052 ROM Packs

For ROM Packs with more than one ROM or EPROM, there are binary images for each ROM.  Each binary image file includes the CHECKSUM-16 for that file.

Photos of each of my ROM Packs including the outside label and circuit boards are also included

Each set of ROM PACK firmware images and photos are in separate folders
-------
I captured each ROM on my DATA I/O with Unipak 2B in Motorola format (82).

I used HxD to import the MOT file, and then used HxD to save the .BIN file.
