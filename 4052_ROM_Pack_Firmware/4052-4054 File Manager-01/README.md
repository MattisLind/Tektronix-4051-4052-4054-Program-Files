My **4052/4054 File Manager 020-0476-01 ROM Pack** contained three Intel 2732A 4KB EPROMs

I used HxD to import the .MOT (Motorola format 82), and save each of the three files as a .BIN file.  

The U13 EPROM has a tape label - I dropped the original part after I captured the data.  U13 is now a NOS Intel 2732A that I programmed from the U13 file.
