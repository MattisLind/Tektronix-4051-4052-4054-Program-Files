My **4052/4054 GPIB Enhancement 4052R14 -00 ROM Pack** contained two Intel 2732A 4KB EPROMs. 
---
This ROM Pack does not work in a 4052A or 4054A  - see my firmware for the 4052R14 1A ROM Pack for the A-Series 

I used HxD to import the .MOT (Motorola format 82), and save each of the three files as a .BIN file.
