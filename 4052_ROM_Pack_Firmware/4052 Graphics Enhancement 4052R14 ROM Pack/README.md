I programmed my Graphics Enhancement ROM Pack from a different 4052 ROM pack with the four 2732A EPROM sockets.

I've also uploaded the full Graphics Enhancement ROM user document and a programs folder with test programs from that document.

See my separate folder for the Graphics Enhancement ROM Demonstration Tape files
