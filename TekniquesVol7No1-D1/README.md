This folder contains files from the 8 inch floppy disk titled "Tekniques Vol. 7 No. 1 D1  062-6715-01"
----
The dump file is from a complete backup of the floppy to tape, that I then ran my Complete Tape Dump program to capture as a single file.

The dump file is all ASCII characters - and includes the file headers and complete copy of each 256 byte tape block.
ASCII files are captured character by character and may include garbage after the header info in that block and garbage after the end of the program.

This 'garbage' is left over information that was previously on that block and not overritten by the header or program.
----------
The BAS programs are the program files from the floppy - they were originally saved in BINARY format on the disk.
I "OLD"ed the programs into my 4054A, then SAVE@40: the programs over the serial interface to a PC that captured the files.
